It seems to me that there is a problem between plotly and latex when one converges ipynb to html. If plotly graphs are included, the latex formulas do not look nicely any. Cutting out the graphs, the latex code work. I couldn't solve this problem till now, so I included a .html file in which the latex-code looks proper.
